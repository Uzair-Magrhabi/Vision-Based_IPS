# Vision-Based_IPS

This project aims to design and develop an affordable indoor positioning system (IPS) to control an autonomous robot capable of operating in dynamic environments such as manufacturing, agriculture, and healthcare. This system will prioritise cost-effectiveness while maintaining high accuracy and adaptability to complex, changing conditions. The project will involve creating a simplified small-scale prototype to serve as a proof of concept, allowing for rigorous testing and evaluation. The insights gained will inform potential scaling of the design for full-scale deployment in real-world applications, ultimately contributing to improved efficiency and automation in various industries.~
